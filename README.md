# Forecasting Future Values of Multiple Time Series
my Insight AI project

## The motivation
Data in the form of time-dependent sequential observations emerge in many key real-world problems, including areas such as biological data, financial markets, demand and supply forecasting, signal collected in IoT and wearable devices, to audio and video processing. The tranditional methods (such as ARIMA) that are based on statistical features (Exponential Moving Average) can do pretty well in single time series prediction, but for multiple time series task, it can not generate predictions based on related time series that have similar pattern. Future values may depends on the previous value, it may also depends on other external time series that has similarity. 
Recurrent Neural networks, and other newer architectures, such as Wavenet and AttentionNet, have showed their success in audio processing and lauguage translation. It's an intersting topic to see how those new deep learning networks perform on multiple time series data, given the fact that they may be able to learn the similarities across different time series.
## The task
The objective of this project is to predict multiple sequences of future values, given the sequences of historical time series data.
